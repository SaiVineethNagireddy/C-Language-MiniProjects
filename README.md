This repository contains a collection of C language mini projects 🖥️ that I have developed as part of my learning journey. Each project focuses on applying basic to intermediate programming concepts such as loops, functions, arrays, conditionals, and string handling.

✨ Some of the projects represent real-life applications like:

🏦 Banking System – simulates simple transactions and account management

🥐 Bakery Order Management – handles item selection and bill generation

🧮 Calculator – performs arithmetic operations

💰 Compound Interest Calculator – computes financial growth

⏰ Digital Clock – displays real-time hours, minutes, and seconds

🎮 There are also fun and interactive programs such as:

🎲 Number Guessing Game – lets you guess the hidden number

✊✋✌ Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) – a console-based classic game

❓ Quiz Game – tests knowledge with questions and scoring

🔑 OTP Generator – creates random secure codes

⚙️ To strengthen fundamentals, I have also included utility-based projects like:

🌡️ Temperature Conversion (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)

⚖️ Weight Conversion (Kg ↔ Pounds)

🔢 Tables Generator (multiplication tables)

✂️ Text Processing (Remove Punctuation)

🚀 These projects highlight the versatility of C programming in solving everyday problems, practicing logic building, and creating engaging console applications. They serve as stepping stones for exploring data structures, file handling, and advanced problem-solving techniques in the future.
